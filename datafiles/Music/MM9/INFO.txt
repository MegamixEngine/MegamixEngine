The music in MM9 differs between console releases, as well as OST's. In particular, the Wii and PS3 verison tend to contain less accurate NES instrumentation, and slightly differing songs, while the 360 version, as well as those in the OST and Legacy Collection 2, use a more accurate instrument set.

The base rips in this folder are of the Wiiware version, as all future releases used streamed audio. However, variants of the instrument set (and specific tracks) have been added, utilizng the Mega Man 10 Wiiware instrument set as a base, resulting in an accuracy very close to that of the later releases. These variants are marked with "_OST" at the end of the file name.

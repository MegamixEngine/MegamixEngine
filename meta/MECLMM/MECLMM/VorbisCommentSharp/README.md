VorbisCommentSharp
==================

This is a small library written in C# that implements the parts of the Ogg Vorbis specifications necessary to read and modify comment metadata in Ogg Vorbis files, and nothing more.

The code in this library makes use of C-style pointers, but encapsulates them in its classes so that calling code (whether in C# or VB.NET) does not need to do the same.

See Program.cs in the Sandbox folder for a usage example.
